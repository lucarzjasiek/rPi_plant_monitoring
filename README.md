# System for acquisition, processing and presentation of important soil parameters from the point of view of plant breeding

Project presents a proposal for the development of a system aimed at facilitating the cultivation and care of plants. It is based on the Pico WH microcontroller manufactured by the British company Raspberry Pi. For measurements, the DS18B20 probe and HW-080 hygrometer were used. Low-cost components were employed, providing a basis for the application of the proposed solutions in a home environment. The entire system was connected on a breadboard. The system was programmed using Micropython, a minimized version of Python adapted for microcontroller handling. Namedtuple from the collections library was used as the database. The interface was created using a website programmed in HTML with the use of CSS and JavaScript. The website includes a dictionary with tabular parameters for selected plants, a display area for current soil conditions, and a selection field for monitoring a specific plant. To create a functional prototype, the above-mentioned methods were integrated. The result of the work was the development of a functioning application for monitoring soil conditions in relation to the requirements of individual plants.
